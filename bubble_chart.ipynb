A classical dataset is the \"day of the Americans\" where you basically see a particle number that represents at what time Americans do specific things like sleep, eat, sports, etc.\n",

    "Here, I wanted to create this for myself and though that I would create a dataset about eduction, employment and unemployment for myself. That is why I simply took 500 rows that specifically described the movement of any \"particle\" in a time-dependent way. This notebook shows how this looks like in the end.\n",
